[1mOVERVIEW[0m
       [4mwiiscan[24m is a canvas function for a number  of  different  scanning  and
       connection utilities. It can detect build-in bluetooth radios, scan for
       nearby bluetooth devices, connect to a specific device and remove  that
       device again from the hardware.

       The main feature of [4mwiiscan[24m is to automatically connect to a wii remote
       (wiimote). This can be quiet cumbersome on a Windows  system,  and  the
       nesseccary steps for doing a robust, working connection is done by


       [1mDelete wiimote hardware HID bluetooth entry:[0m
               delete old entries of the wiimote in the bluetooth hardware. On
               some windows system the wiimote is readily detected, after  the
               first  manually  installation.  Pressing  the  "1-2"  makes the
               wiimote discoverable. On other systems  (including  mine),  any
               attempt  to connect to the wiimote, after one successful or un-
               successful connection attempt, will always fail!  Removing  the
               HID  and wiimote registry entries before the next attempt cures
               this feature.


       [1mCycle USB bus:[0m
               the wiimote can be switched automatically to discoverable mode,
               if  the  power is briefly cut from the device. This can be done
               on a wiimote powered by the USB +5 volt (with a proper  voltage
               regulator to bring it under +3 volt). This step hence turns the
               USB hub off, killing the power, and  turns  it  on  again.  The
               "1-2" buttons on the wiimote must be pressed at all times, done
               by say some tape or gaffa!.


       [1mScan for wiimote:[0m
               now comes the main part  of  the  connection;  scanning  for  a
               wiimote.  This includes bringing up the bluetooth radio device,
               initialize seek parameters, scanning and matching for a  device
               name or address, connecting to a matched device, installing the
               HID interface (that was removed in the first step), and finally
               trying  to  open the wiimote and reading some data from it. All
               steps involve a time variable, meaning that say installing  the
               HID  causes some windows registry fiddling, that takes a rather
               variable amount of time, and the next step is critically depen‚Äê
               dent  on the former step to be finished. Hence a number of tun‚Äê
               able waiting variable is introduced, Important is to being able
               to  reach the final connection step before the wiimote goes out
               of the discoverable mode and automatically turns off.


       A note on USB voltage cycling:
               This software solution is able to restart the wiimote  in  dis‚Äê
               coverable mode automatically. But this require that the wiimote
               is powered by a USB cable to the PC and that the  "1-2"  button
               combination  is  permanently pressed. Cycling the power for the
               wiimote with the "1-2" buttons pressed enables the discoverable
               mode,  and  the  continuously pressing "1-2" does not interfere
               with wiimote operations hereafter.

               So this is a non-intrusive fix to the so called  "Ladder  prob‚Äê
               lem" (http:wyxs.net/web/wiimote/digital_whiteboard.html).

               Power  control over USB hubs is dependent on the particular hub
               devices, and disabling the power may not be possible for a sin‚Äê
               gle  USB  port  only. [4mwiiscan[24m uses a trick of disabling all USB
               hubs and then only enable and disable a singe hub.

               Disabling all hubs is a precondition to running [4mwiiscan[24m and  it
               can be accomblised by either going into "Control Panel | System
               | Hardware | Device manager", and manually disable all USB hubs
               or by using "devcon", say (careful, these commands applies only
               to my system)

                 devcon           disable            "@PCIN_8086&DEV_293*&SUB‚Äê
               SYS_20F117AA&REV_033&B1BfB6*"

                 devcon            disable           "@PCIN_8086&DEV_293*&SUB‚Äê
               SYS_20F017AA&REV_033&B1BfB6*"

               being careful that the pattern matches only our USB hubs!.  You
               can test this by

                 devcon            status            "@PCIN_8086&DEV_293*&SUB‚Äê
               SYS_20F117AA&REV_033&B1BfB6*"

                 devcon            status            "@PCIN_8086&DEV_293*&SUB‚Äê
               SYS_20F017AA&REV_033&B1BfB6*"

               A single USB now may be enabled or disabled by

                 devcon disable @PCIN_8086*DEV_2934*SUBSYS_20F017AA*

               again with the particular address for your system as a variable
               you need to lookup. The voltage on  the  USB  bus  can  now  be
               checked     Using     a     voltmeter     (see    details    in
               http:wyxs.net/web/wiimote/digital_whiteboard.html).


       NOTE: The configuration file of wiiscan contains the particular  system
       dependent USB hub pattern matches.


       NOTE: be careful of connecting other devices to the USB bus, since  the
       power cycle may cause severe interfere with the device.

               Installing new hardware causes windows to require restart. Hap‚Äê
               pens  once  in  a while, balloon pop-ups reports hardware, that
               where installed but not  working  properly.  A  restart  pop-up
               wants  to  reboot the PC. Small fix: just delete the device and
               re-run "wiiscan -c nintendo".

               FIX: the 'Change of systemsettings ... Do you  want  to  reboot
               now?' popup, happens only when the program runs for longer than
               19 seconds. Keeping the connection time within 19 sec seems  to
               cure the problem, Adding a sleep at the end of the program, say
               Sleep(20000) will eventually bring up  the  dialog  again.  The
               dialog can anyway safly be ignored!


       [1m2: discoverable mode fast shutdown (FIXED)[0m
               Sometimes the wiimote goes quickly out of discoverable mode, it
               takes it only about 3 seconds from turn-on  to  turn-off.  This
               makes  it  hard  to obtain a connection to it. Both my wiimotes
               does this once in a while, after failed connection attempts.

               Pressing one button only "1" or "2" makes the wiimote blink for
               a short time, but it is not really discoverable.

               FIX:  Initialization  of  wiilib  has been rewritten, making it
               recall the HID  inialization  routine.  Code  for  testing  the
               wiimote connection has also been introduced.

               the  "1-2  button  freeze"  happens  after  a failed connection
               attempt. See also bug-2.

               Code stalls here:

               DeviceAutoClose<HBLUETOOTH_DEVICE_FIND,BOOL> hbf(BluetoothFind‚Äê
               FirstDevice(&bdsp,&bdi),&BluetoothFindDeviceClose);

               FIX: start the BluetoothFindFirstDevice() function in a thread,
               terminate the thread if it has run for longer than, say 2+time‚Äê
               out.

               If a connection attempt goes well until the last  part,  it  is
               most likely due to low-power batteries. The final stage of con‚Äê
